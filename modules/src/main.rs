// If we moved what is inside the curly braces into another file, then this would become a module
// load, however you only need to do this once in the module tree. The mod keyword is unlike the

// Here, my_module has to be in the same scope and do_something must be public in order to access.
// Similar principles apply to structs and enums as well. The key difference being the structs
// individual fields can have the pub keyword. Generally, this would not be idiomatic because for
// functions you want to import the module, not the full path. For structs...
use my_module::do_something;
// This would be idiomatic to specify the full path for structs, enums, etc. You can also use the
// as keyword to rename something upon import. You can also re-export something by adding the pub
// keyword before use.
pub use my_module::MyStruct as Struct;

// You can use the self keyword in an import which in this example means use my_module.
// use my_module::{self, MyStruct};
// You can also bring in all public items definied into scope by using the glob opeartor or the *.
